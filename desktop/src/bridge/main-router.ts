/**
 * Main-process IPC router for the single `native:invoke` channel.
 *
 * Registers one handler that resolves `(module, method)` against the native
 * registry and dispatches. Unknown pairs throw a {@link NativeError}; any
 * throw (unknown or from the impl) is caught and returned as a
 * `{ __nativeError: SerializedError }` envelope, which the renderer proxy
 * (`useNative` / Task 8) revives into a {@link NativeError} and rethrows.
 * Keeping the error convention as a returned envelope — rather than a rejected
 * promise — gives the proxy a single, structured-clone-safe shape to detect.
