# Running Your App

One codebase, three targets. Each platform has its own dev loop, all driven by the
`sublime` CLI. Whenever something looks off, `sublime doctor` checks your
environment and platform toolchains.

## Web

The web target runs your `screens/web/` screens with the MUI theme generated from
your tokens, behind the `navigation.tsx` (react-router) output of
`build:nav`. Develop it with your project's standard web dev server from the
`web/` entry — re-run `sublime build:nav` whenever you change a storybook so the
generated navigation stays in sync.

## Mobile

Mobile runs your `screens/mobile/` screens with React Native + Paper.

Build an offline Android APK:

```bash
npx @sublime-ui/devkit build
```

`sublime build` produces an offline Android APK. To install and launch it on a
connected device, use `run`:

```bash
npx @sublime-ui/devkit run
```

`sublime run` installs the build and launches it on the device.

## Desktop

Desktop reuses your **web UI** inside an Electron shell (via Electron Forge) and
adds a typed native bridge for Node/OS capabilities. There are no separate desktop
screens.

Start the desktop app in development, with Forge and HMR:

```bash
npx @sublime-ui/devkit desktop:dev
```

`sublime desktop:dev` runs Forge start with hot module replacement, so edits to
your web screens reload live in the desktop window.

Package installers for distribution:

```bash
npx @sublime-ui/devkit desktop:build
```

`sublime desktop:build` runs Forge make to produce Windows, macOS, and Linux
installers.

### Calling native code

From any screen, reach a native service with `useNative` — it returns `null` on
plain web and a typed client on desktop, so the same screen code works on both:

```ts
import { useNative } from '@sublime-ui/desktop';
import type { Printer } from '../../native/printer.service';

const printer = useNative<Printer>('printer'); // null on plain web
await printer?.print(receipt);
```

Because the renderer imports only `import type` of a service, Node dependencies
never leak into the web bundle. Built-in services include `fs`, `dialog`,
`shell`, `clipboard`, and `notifications`.

## The loop at a glance

| Platform | Develop | Build / Package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web | Web dev server (`web/` entry) | Your web bundler |
| Mobile | `sublime run` | `sublime build` (offline Android APK) |
| Desktop | `sublime desktop:dev` | `sublime desktop:build` |

Re-run `sublime build:nav` after any navigation change, and reach for `sublime
doctor` whenever a toolchain needs a sanity check.
